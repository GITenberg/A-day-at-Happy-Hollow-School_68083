Arranges books and papers on desk.

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Joshua Judkins.”</p>

<p><i>Joshua Judkins.</i> “Present.”</p>

<p>(Other names may be added.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “First class in geography, come forward.”</p>

<p>(Advance Annabel, Dennis, Etta, Curiosity
and Joshua.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Now Annabel, you tell me this. If
to the right of you is the South, and on your
left the North, and in front of you the East—what’s
behind you?”</p>

<p>Annabel thinks a moment, then starts to cry.
“Boo hoo! I knowed it. I told ma you’d see
them buttons missin’ off my waist.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Ridiculous! I mean the West.
Now listen children! Does anybody remember
what the population of China is?” (All shake
heads negatively.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, the population of China is so
great that two Chinamen die every time you take
a breath.”</p>

<p>(Etta immediately starts purring furiously.
Keeps it up until spoken to.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Dennis Dockerty go to the board
and draw the map of New Jersey.”</p>

<p>(Dennis goes, but draws instead a tree, one
branch of which is longer than the others, and
has on it three disks representing fruit.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (just then observing Etta’s flushed
face and energetic puffs): “Why Etta Elephant,
what’s the matter? What on earth are you
doing?”</p>

<p><i>Etta Elephant.</i> “Killing Chinamen. I never
did like them foreigners what me father calls
aliens, and I’m getting rid of them as fast as I
can.”</p>

<p>(Teacher throws up hands in exasperation.
Turns to blackboard.)</p>

<p>“Why Dennis Dockerty that’s not the map of
New Jersey.”</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> “Please, ma’am, my big brother says
New Jersey’s like a fruit tree, ’cause it’s got a
Long Branch, three Oranges and a Lemon.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (meditatively): “Y-e-s, East Orange,
West Orange and South Orange—but where’s
the Lemon?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span><i>Dennis</i> (saucily). “You’re the Lemon.”</p>

<p><i>Other Scholars.</i> “O-h-h!”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Go to your seat.”</p>

<p>(Dennis goes, shuffling his feet and sulking for
some time.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Curiosity, your father is a sailor;
would it be possible for him to start to-day to
go round the world, and keep sailing always in
the same direction till he came back to his starting-point?”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “No, Miss Fitzimmons, pop’s laid
up with rheumatism.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Dear me! What ails you all to be
so stupid to-day. Joshua, have we anything in
our country as wonderful as the great volcano,
Mt. Vesuvius, which continually pours out smoke
and molten lava?”</p>

<p><i>Joshua.</i> “Sure—give Niagara Falls a chance,
it will put the whole thing out in a minute.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Very good. You may take your
seats.”</p>

<p>(Class obey.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Next is the class in General Information.
Forward.”</p>

<p>(Advance Bessie, Geraldine, Fanny, Henry,
Isaac and Ira.)</p>

<p>(In the meantime Etta is seen chewing gum
vigorously, and planting her feet conspicuously
in the aisle as she fidgets about.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (impressively). “Bessie, tell me what
you would think if you saw the Stars and Stripes
waving over the field of battle?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span><i>Bessie</i> (innocently). “I’d think that the wind
was blowing.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Awful!” (observes Etta). “Etta
Elephant, take your gum out of your mouth, and
put your feet in immediately.” (Etta does this
literally in pantomime.)</p>

<p>(Just then Curiosity pipes up, raising hand as
she asks.) “Teacher, did you ever see a hair
die?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Certainly <i>not</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity Cornhusk.</i> “Or ink stand?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “<i>No!</i> Do be quiet.” (Turns to
class.) “Now do you know whether any one is
going to try to discover the South Pole?”</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> “Oi ain’t going.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Oh, Fanny, my child, you must not
say, ‘I ain’t going.’ You must say, ‘I am not
going.’ It’s like this: ‘I am not going; he is
not going; she is not going; we are not going;
you are not going; they are not going.’ Now,
can you say all that Fanny?”</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> “Shure Oi can. ‘There ain’t nobody
going.’”</p>

<p>Teacher waves her aside in despair. Asks
others: “Which of you can describe the backbone?”</p>

<p><i>Geraldine</i> (raises hand, standing on one foot
in her eagerness to answer). “The backbone is
something that holds up the head and ribs, and
keeps you from having legs clear up your neck.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Now, children, what is a cat covered
with? Is it wool? Is it fur? Is it feathers?
Is it hair?”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> (pipes up): “Say, ain’t you honest
never seen a cat?”</p>

<p>(The others answer in chorus): “Fur.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Geraldine, what is dew?”</p>

<p><i>Geraldine.</i> “The earth revolves on its own
axis three hundred and sixty-five times in twenty-four
hours. This rapid motion through space
causes it to perspire. This is called dew.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Henry, where was the Declaration
of Independence signed?”</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> “At the bottom, ma’am.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “What is mathematics, Isaac?”</p>

<p><i>Isaac.</i> “Dunno.”</p>

<p><i>Ira.</i> “Me neither.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, mathematics is the science
that treats of measurement or numbering. For
instance: If it takes one man twelve days to build
a house, then twelve men can build it in one
day. That’s mathematics.”</p>

<p>(Isaac and Ira put heads together over pencil
and paper while teacher asks next question.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Bessie, if your mother bought four
baskets of grapes, the dealer’s price being a quarter
a basket, how much would the purchase cost
her?”</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> “You never can tell. Ma’s great at a
bargain.”</p>

<p>(Isaac and Ira wave their hands to attract
attention.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, Isaac? Well, Ira?”</p>

<p><i>Isaac.</i> “Say Miss Fitzimmons, me’n Ira’s figgered
out that two hundred and eighty-eight
men will build it in one hour; seventeen thousand
two hundred and eighty, in a minute,
and—”</p>

<p><i>Ira</i> (interrupts). “And one million, thirty-six
thousand eight hundred men will put it up in a
second, an’—”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “There, that will do—that’s quite
enough. I see you understand the meaning of
mathematics fully.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> (raises hand and asks). “Please,
teacher, did you ever see a stone step, or a bed
spring, or a apple turn over?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Curiosity Cornhusk, I want you to
stop asking questions at once. Don’t you know
that curiosity once killed a cat?” (Curiosity is
thoughtful.) “Children, you may all take your
seats.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Please, teacher, what was it the
cat wanted to know?”</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (sinks into chair). “Somebody bring
me a glass of water, quick!”</p>

<p>(Geraldine gravely goes to pail in the corner
and brings a large tin dipper full. Teacher revives.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Children I wanted to speak to you
about that poor family who have just moved into
the old brown house in the Hollow. The father
is just getting up from a sick-bed and not able
to work yet and I hear there’s scarcely a thing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
eat in the house, and to-morrow is Thanksgiving,
you know. I do wish we could send them a
good dinner. Can any of you think of a way
to manage it without asking too much of our
parents?”</p>

<p>(A loud knock is heard at the outer door.
While teacher answers it scholars occupy themselves
with throwing spit-balls, and various
pranks of school children. She returns.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “There are two automobiles just
down the hill. They got off the main road by
mistake, and one of them is broken down, and
the men are trying to get it fixed up. They
wanted to know if there was any place near here
where they could get something to eat. The one
at the door says they’re ‘positively starving,’
and would be willing to pay a good round sum
for anything fit to eat. You know there is no
house nearer than old Mr. Dawson’s and—”</p>

<p><i>Annabel.</i> “Don’t send ’em there, teacher;
Mis’ Dawson is just doin’ her washin’ to-day,
and she’ll most likely have a cold bite.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “That’s true—and the next place is
Mr. Temple’s—”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “I saw ’em drivin’ off to town as
I came by, an’ the house was all shut up.”</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Then there’s quite a stretch between
there and your place, Bessie.”</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> “Mercy! Don’t send them there, Miss
Fitzimmons. Mother’s makin’ mince-meat and
cookin’ up pumpkin for pies, and she’d be all
upset.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span><i>Teacher.</i> “Well, it appears there isn’t very
good promise of lunch for these wayfarers unless
we help them out. What do you say if we
sell our lunches to them and take the proceeds
to buy supplies for the folks down in the Hollow?
We only have a short session after recess
on account of the holiday, so you wouldn’t get
so terribly hungry before you go home. I’ll
leave you here for awhile, and if you decide to
make this sacrifice you can place your lunches
on my desk.”</p>

<p>(Scholars immediately begin discussion; some
for, some against proposed disposal of lunches;
all talking at once and moving about.)</p>

<p>(Presently Annabel rises, sighs and slowly advances
to desk, placing basket there, and saying:)
“I hate to give up that piece of pumpkin pie, but
I couldn’t relish it thinking of that Hollow family;
I’ve been hollow myself.” (This is funnier
if the speaker is a stout girl.)</p>

<p><i>Bessie</i> (follows her example). “All I hope is
that the stew don’t all get et up before I get
home to-day.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Guess I’ll keep mine.”</p>

<p><i>Dennis.</i> “I love my lunch, but oh! them hungry
kids.” (Goes forward.)</p>

<p><i>Geraldine.</i> “Guess I’m as generous as anybody.”
(Adds her lunch.)</p>

<p><i>Etta</i> to <i>Curiosity</i>. “You’d ought to be
ashamed of yourself.” (Arises.) “My lunch is
out in the cloak-room; I’ll go get it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>(While she is gone, Curiosity puts her lunch
with the rest, sighing:) “I’ll do it, but I guess
I’ll die like that Curiosity cat; I’ll be so hungry.”
(Thoughtfully.) “Wonder what that cat <i>did</i>
want to know anyhow.”</p>

<p><i>Joshua.</i> “Guess if they can stand them biscuits
of Sis’s, I oughtn’t to kick.”</p>

<p>(Etta returns with huge basket, which she
deposits with an air of importance on the desk.
Looks contemptuously at Curiosity.)</p>

<p><i>Fanny.</i> “And I bet you we won’t have nothin’
but fried praties and onions for supper. But
maybe <i>they</i> ain’t got even them.” (Puts bag
with others.)</p>

<p>(Isaac and Ira go up together, saying:) “And
there’s ours.”</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> “Here’s mine, too.”</p>

<p><i>Etta</i> to <i>Curiosity</i>. “There, you see; everybody’s
give up their lunch but you, you little
stingy, contrary, stubborn, selfish, tight-fisted,
over-fed, pie-faced pig you—”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Are you through?”</p>

<p><i>Etta.</i> “Yes.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Ain’t you got nothin’ more to
say?”</p>

<p><i>Etta.</i> “No.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> “Well, all of them things you called
me you are. I put my lunch there when you
went after yours.”</p>

<p><i>Etta</i> (repentently). “Oh, I take it all back.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity</i> (cordially). “All right, you’re welcome.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>(Enter teacher.)</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Ah, this looks as if everybody has
been generous. I’m proud of you. You’re all
true friends in need. But I was sure you’d do
it, so I spoke to the gentleman at the door and
he says, he will consider it a bargain at any price
we say, and will be back with his friends soon.
Now for the recitations. Each one of you try
to recite something, if only a stanza. And after
all have recited, I will call for the fire drill, and
all be ready to respond immediately. Don’t hesitate,
do as you would if the building was really
on fire. Now, Annabel you’re first on the roll,
so you begin speaking.”</p>

<p>Annabel comes forward, bows, announces:
“Mary’s Little Lamb.” Bows again, and recites
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Some folks say that fleas is black,</div>
<div class="indent">But that ain’t true I know,</div>
<div class="verse">For Mary had a little lamb</div>
<div class="indent">Its fleas was white as snow.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Now Bessie, it’s your turn.”</p>

<p><i>Bessie.</i> “Me and Curiosity’s got one together.”</p>

<p><i>Curiosity.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“I asked my Pa a simple thing,</div>
<div class="indent">Where holes in doughnuts go?</div>

</div></div>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> “Now, Dennis.”</p>

<p><i>Dennis recites.</i></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“The lady in the street-car</div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
